# Geographically weighted regression-derived colorectal cancer screening disparity target zones for Hispanic/Latino ancestral groups

This project was pursued to identify census tracts with disproportionately negative relationships between Hispanic/Latino group populations and colorectal cancer screening rates. Some census tract shapes in the interactive web map are rougher than their true form to improve web performace of the map, which results in error overlaps in certain areas that don't exist on other census tract maps. The analytic dataset can be found in the "Data" folder.
