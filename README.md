# Geographically weighted regression-derived colorectal cancer screening disparity target areas for Hispanic/Latino subgroups

This web map was created to identify census tracts with disproportionately negative relationships between Hispanic/Latino subgroup populations and colorectal cancer screening rates. Some census tract shapes are rougher than their true form to improve web performace of the map, which results in error overlaps in certain areas that don't exist on other census tract maps.
